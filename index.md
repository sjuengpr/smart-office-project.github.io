**Introduction**

**Motivation**
In order to improve the comfort, wellness, and health of workers, we want to create a smart office sensor system. During a normal workday, the temperature is constantly varying, in the morning it can be cold, you can have the windows closed but during the afternoon the weather can change completely, and connecting and disconnecting fans or opening or closing windows is inefficient and disturbs the work of employees since these are tasks that no one additionally wants to do. At this time with the current COVID 19 pandemic situation it is important to measure CO2 in an office and to alert opening windows or excess people when there are more people than recommended to prevent contagion. On the other hand, offices are currently not energy efficient since even when there is only one worker at his workstation, all the lights in his area are on, and this is not optimal in a world with limited resources for future generations.

**Goals**
- Control the fan so it automatically turns on when the DHT11  Temperature and Humidity  detects temperatures higher than 25 degrees Celsius  (77 degrees Fahrenheit).
- Automatizaci√≥n of the lightning in an office to increase energy efficiency through the use of the HC-SR501 Infrared PIR Motion Sensor Module.
- Send an alert, which in this project would be to turn one LED on when the  Adafruit SCD-30 - NDIR CO2, Temperature and Humidity sensor detects 1000 ppm.

**Physical Principles**
Temperature:
It is a physical quantity that expresses hot and cold. It is the manifestation of thermal energy present in all matter. The temperature is measured with thermometers that are calibrated in different temperature scales that have used various reference points and thermometric substances for definition. However, human perception of hotness or coldness is relative. For instance, people living in colder climates as in Greenland could consider a cold temperature as low as -10 degrees Celsius (14 fahrenheit degrees) but for someone living in Brazil, the cold temperature could be less than 10 degrees Celsius (50 fahrenheit degrees). The lowest theoretical temperature is he absolute zero, which means that at this temperature no more thermal energy can be extracted from a body.

CO2:
Carbon Dioxide or CO2 is a greenhouse gas that is natural and harmless when it is presented in small quantities, but if its levels rise it can affect productivity and also sleep. Its density is 53% higher than that of dry air and its molecules consist of a carbon atom covalently double bonded to two oxygen atoms. This gas is produced mostly in indoor spaces by the air people exhale, and its levels concentrate with less ventilation. Nowadays buildings have implemented ventilation systems that recycle air and move the contaminated air around rather than cycling in new air. Which results in high levels of CO2 concentration and poor indoor air quality. Moreover, CO2 emissions are the primary driver of global climate change and it is widely recognized that to avoid the worst impacts in climate change, the globe needs to lower these CO2 emissions.
